        <h2>The Story of Kalinga Weaving</h2>
        <p>
          In the heart of the Cordillera mountains, the Kalinga people continue
          one of the Philippinesâ€™ most vibrant textile traditions. Kalinga
          weaving is more than artistry â€” it is identity woven into cloth, a
          tapestry of ancestral memory, community values, and the sacred
          relationship between humanity and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally woven by women on backstrap looms, Kalinga textiles are
          known for their bold red, black, and white stripes, geometric motifs,
          and intricate borders. Each design carries symbolic meaning: diamonds
          symbolize fertility, zigzags depict flowing rivers, and repeated lines
          represent unity and continuity within the tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, woven textiles were integral to Kalinga social life.
          They were used as garments, dowries, offerings, and markers of social
          status. Special patterns were reserved for tribal leaders or warriors,
          and weaving itself was considered a sacred duty passed down through
          generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colonialism and modernity challenged these traditions, but Kalinga
          weaving endured. Today, master weavers and young artisans are
          revitalizing the craft by blending traditional patterns with
          contemporary applications â€” from fashion collections to home dÃ©cor and
          cultural exhibitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the world seeks sustainable, meaningful craftsmanship, Kalinga
          weaving stands as a testament to cultural resilience. Each fabric is a
          dialogue between past and present, a declaration that heritage is not
          a relic but a living force â€” woven, worn, and proudly shared with the
          world.
